<p>The binary.com websockets service is at</p>

<pre>wss://www.binary.com/websockets/v2</pre>

<p>Open a connection to Binary.com WebSocket service:</p>

<pre data-language="javascript">var ws = new WebSocket('wss://www.binary.com/websockets/v2');</pre>

<p>You can now send data down the websocket using any of the messages described in this Reference.</p>

<p>Depending on the call, one or many messages will be sent back to you.</p>

<p></p>The Websockets API may be accessed in any language. <a href="/demos">View code samples</a></p>

Note: to receive responses where English text has been translated to another language, append the language code to the connection URL as follows:

<pre data-language="javascript">var ws = new WebSocket('wss://www.binary.com/websockets/v2?l=RU');</pre>

<h2>Sending and Receiving Messages</h2>

<p>All movement of data in both directions is done with structured JSON-encoded data. All field name identifiers, and most field values, will be double-quoted in the encoded data.</p>

<p>The same applies to receiving messages: each message is a serialized JSON-encoded string.</p>
