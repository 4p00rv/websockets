<h1>Websockets</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://www.binary.com">Binary.com</a> Websockets API uses the state-of-the-art <a target=_blank href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API">WebSockets</a> protocol to allow fast, two-way messaging between client programs and Binary.com trading services.</p>

<p>To open a connection to Binary.com WebSocket service (in Javascript), do:</p>

<pre data-language="javascript">var ws = new WebSocket('wss://ws.binaryws.com/websockets/v3?app_id=XXX');</pre>

where app_id is your Application ID obtained as described in the <a href="/guide">Guide</a>.

<p>For other languages, <a href="/demos">View code samples</a></p>

<p>You can now send data up and down the websocket using any of the messages described in this Reference.</p>

<p>Note: to receive responses where English text has been translated to another language, append the language code to the connection URL as follows:</p>

<pre data-language="javascript">var ws = new WebSocket('wss://ws.binaryws.com/websockets/v3?app_id=XXX&l=RU');</pre>

<p>Data transfer in both directions is done with structured JSON-encoded data. All field name identifiers, and most field values, will be double-quoted in the encoded data. The same applies to receiving messages: each message is a serialized JSON-encoded string.</p>
