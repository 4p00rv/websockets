<p>The binary.com websockets service is at</p>

<pre>wss://ws.binary.com/websockets/v1</pre>

<p>(version 2, which is under beta development, is available at /v2).</p>

<p>Open a connection to Binary.com WebSocket service:</p>

<pre data-language="javascript">var ws = new WebSocket('wss://ws.binary.com/websockets/v1');</pre>

<p>You can now send data down the websocket using any of the messages described in this Reference.</p>

<p>Depending on the call, zero, one or many messages will be sent back to you.</p>

<p>All the examples in this Reference assume that a websocket object named 'ws' has already been opened as shown above.</p>

<h2>Sending and Receiving Messages</h2>

<p>All movement of data in both directions is done with structured JSON-encoded data. All field name identifiers, and most field values, will be double-quoted in the encoded data.  You can avoid the tedious problem of constructing your own JSON strings by invoking the built-in JSON.stringify method on an in-line Javascript object.</p>

<p>The same applies to receiving messages. Each message is a serialized JSON-encoded string, you need to parse it using JSON.parse().</p>

<p>All of our examples use this technique.</p>

<p>Combining some of the examples, here is a JavaScript snippet that opens a websocket, and requests a stream of updates for the symbol "R_100".  On receipt of each message, it outputs a message to the console.</p>

<pre data-language="javascript">var ws = new WebSocket(&#39;wss://ws.binary.com/websockets/v1&#39;);

ws.onopen = function(evt) {
    ws.send(JSON.stringify({ticks:&#39;R_100&#39;}));
};

ws.onmessage = function(msg) {
   var data = JSON.parse(msg.data);
   console.log(&#39;ticks update: %o&#39;, data);
};
</pre>
