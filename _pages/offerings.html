<h5>Retrieve a hierarchical tree structure of all or filtered current Contract offerings.</h5>

<h3>Send</h3>

<p data-schema="/config/v1/offerings/send.json"></p>

<p data-example="/examples/offerings-req.json"></code>

<p>Supply an empty OPTIONS object (i.e. {offerings: {} } to apply the defaults and get all offerings.</p>

<h3>Receive</h3>

<p data-schema="/config/v1/offerings/receive.json"></p>

<p data-response="/examples/offerings-req.json"></code>

<p>The OFFERINGS structure is a hierarchy of Market -> SubMarket -> Symbol -> ContractCategory -> Contract Type. At each node is a node identifier, and an array named "available" which lists the entries at the next lower level.</p>

<p>The SELECTORS structure is a summary of the frequency of all contract parameters appearing in the output. This is useful information if the front-end is building further drill-down filters on the offerings tree.</p>
