<p>The binary.com websockets service is at this URL:</p>

<pre>wss://ws.binary.com/websockets/contracts</pre>

<p>There are several useful references for this object such as [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket) .</p>

<p>This will open the Binary.com WebSocket service:</p>

<pre><p data-language="javascript">var ws = new WebSocket('wss://ws.binary.com/websockets/contracts');
</code></pre>

<p>You can now 'send' data down the websocket using any of the messages described in this Reference.</p>

<p>Depending on the call, zero, one or many messages will be sent back to you.</p>

<p>All the examples in this Reference assume that a websocket object named 'ws' has already been opened as shown above.</p>

<p>All movement of data in both directions is done with structured JSON-encoded data.  This means that all field name identifiers, and most field values, will be double-quoted in the encoded data.  You can avoid the tedious problem of constructing your own JSON strings by invoking the built-in JSON.stringify method on an in-line Javascript object.</p>

<p>The same applies to receiving messages.  Each message is a serialized JSON-encoded string, and so you would normally start by 'inflating' it to a Javascript object using JSON.parse.</p>

<p>All of our examples use this technique.</p>

<p>Combining some of the examples, here is a javascript fragment that opens a websocket, and requests a stream of updates for the symbol "R_100".  On receipt of each message, it generates a console line allowing inspection of the message.</p>

<pre><p data-language="javascript">var ws = new WebSocket('wss://ws.binary.com/websockets/contracts');

ws.onmessage = function(msg) {
   var data = JSON.parse(msg.data);
   console.log('ticks update: %o', data);
};

ws.send(JSON.stringify({authorize: "0d4abc3j3MTabcQJnmabcactabd"}));
ws.send(JSON.stringify({ticks:'R_100'}));
</code></pre>
