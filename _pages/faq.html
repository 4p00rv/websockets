<p>
     If you are prepared for your app to offer higher contract prices than the main Binary.com website, you may add a <b>markup percentage</b> when you <a href="https://developers.binary.com/applications/">Register your App</a>. This markup percentage is a percentage of contract payouts, and is added to all contract prices in your app. At every month-end, the aggregate markup is paid to you. Please sign up as an affiliate and contact your Affiliate Manager to learn more about this facility.
