<h5>Receive information about my current portfolio, and receive regular pricing updates for each entry</h5>

<h3>Send</h3>

<p data-schema="config/v1/portfolio/send.json"></p>

<code data-example="examples/portfolio-req.json"></code>

<h3>Receive</h3>

<p data-schema="config/v1/portfolio/receive.json"></p>

<p>For each portfolio entry, (i.e. an open contract), an initial message will provide information about that contract. Example:</p>

<code data-response="examples/portfolio-req.json"></code>

<p>The id here is a handle that identifies this contract. From this point in time on, update messages identified by this handle will arrive, to update any of the pricing information in that contract. This is how a front-end can monitor in real time the spot price of the symbol and the "sell price" that allows the trader to sell back the contract. </p>
