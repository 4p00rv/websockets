<h1>Welcome to the Binary.com API</h1>

<p>The Binary.com API allows developers to build applications and trading interfaces that interact with the binary.com system.</p>

<p>The API allows for most of the read and write methods that you will need to support your application. If you have uses or needs that are not currently supported by the API, drop by the <a target=_blank href="https://binary.vanillacommunity.com">Dev Forum</a> and let us know!</p>

<p>Starting with the API is easy:</p>

<ul class="bullet">
    <li>Read the <a href="/websockets">Quick Start</a> and look at our <a href="/demos">code samples in different languages</a></li>
    <li><a href="/applications">Register your application</a> so as to obtain an app_id</li>
    <li>Read the <a href="/guide">Binary API Guide</a></li>
    <li>Explore the API using the <a href="/api">API Playground</a></li>
</ul>

<p>We also provide a higher-level api library, to help you use our service easier.</p>
